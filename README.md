# Thank you for downloading!!!
These liveries are based off of Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. These aren't my vehicles, I only made the liveries, and added handling files for the majority of them. Credits to the original versions are linked down below.

/////Light Patterns\\\\\

Since this pack is based off of LASD, all vehicles must abide by the California emergency vehicle regulations. Red steady burns were added to at least one of the front-facing lights on every vehicle. this is because according to California Vehicle Code Sec. 25252.5., "Every authorized emergency vehicle is required to have one steady burning red lamp that is visible from 1000 feet. California Vehicle Code Sec. 25252. These vehicles may also have a revolving flashing or steady light system on the upper beam headlamps that alternates from one side to the other..." Obviously LASD is an authorized emergency response team with authorized emergency vehicles.
